# botris-board-string-generator
set up test positions and convert them into the [Botris Battle board array](https://botrisbattle.com/docs#gamestate).

click and drag on the board to enable blocks then specify the block type ([ I | J | L | O | S | T | Z | G ](https://botrisbattle.com/docs#block)) and null keyword (from the language you're using).

exporting the board as a .json file will replace the null keyword with `null`.
